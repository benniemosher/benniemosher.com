description: I helped develop JavaScript runners and jobs that were used to
  manage assets in Asset Management Systems such as Mediator. I led and helped
  move the engineering team to a Test Driven Development culture. I solely
  developed the TDD environment for proprietary software using tools such as
  Jasmine, Vagrant, Rhino.js, Jenkins and GitHub Enterprise. I developed a REST
  API microservice in Express.js and MongoDB to watch directories and make REST
  API calls when there is a file available to take action on.
