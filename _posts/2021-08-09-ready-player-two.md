Foreclosure I was a big fan of the first book in this series, "Ready Player One." I read RP1 before it was a movie via the Audible service, in one week's drive. Ernest captured lots of 80s cultural references in ways that were fun and unlike anything I had read to that point. The movie was equally fun for me, and I felt like it was true to the book. I was very excited and anticipated the second book in the series, "Ready Player Two."

"Ready Player Two" was fun and took me on a journey I was not expecting. After reading the book, I was not surprised by the direction that Ernest took with the book. The classic AI armageddon storyline, and it wasn't bad. I have not read a bunch of sci-fi books or books about AI. The genre is a newer discovery for me. After reading a bunch of reviews on GoodReads.com, I was disappointed to see that other seasoned authors were let down by the book. I can say that during reading the book when I found out there was a neural network interface I knew that Sam would be against it and the rest would be for it. I was able to predict that at least.

I however was extremely pleased with the book and the new cultural references that it included. Having some of the final scenes be from the LOTR universe was exciting, and something that I was not expecting. It has inspired me to go back and reread all 5 books, The Hobbit, LOTR, and Simarillion. I hope that they take the time to turn this into a movie, some of these visuals would be amazing.

Overall, I thought that this book was great, and Ernest Cline did not disappoint me. I could not put this book down and read it visually in two weeks, which is historically really fast for me. I was letting my wife drive places so I could have my head buried in the book, much like my teenage self reading the Junior Jedi Knights series!
